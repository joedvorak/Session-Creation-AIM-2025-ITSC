# Automated Session Creation for AIM 2025 (ITSC Only) Web App
This web app is based on Streamlit. It creates a simple web page for exploring the sessions created using an automated process. 

It contains data from presentations submitted to the ITSC Techincal Community for consideration in AIM 2025.

The raw initial submission data is not shared in this repository. The intial data included the abstracts which were not labeled for public release. The data available here includes the initial datset without the abstracts (itsc_clustered_presentations_no_abstracts.pkl). The similarities (itsc_oral_app_similarities.pkl) produced by the text embedding model from the titles and abstracts are included.

The spreadsheet used to analyze patterns in the LLM suggested titles and keywords is also included (Gemini_Llama_session.xlsx).
